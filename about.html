				<p>
					My name is Charles, I'm 32 and I've had prior experience with some
					minor web coding (HTML and CSS). Throughout my twenties, I co-hosted
					and ran a few fan based art and writing fests online which gave me
					tons of experience in various areas including: sending out emails,
					designing advertising and web design, pairing up partners, dealing
					with backend data, releasing news and event submissions, moderating
					discord chats, and much more.
				</p>

				<p>
					For fun, my favorite hobbies are to draw, paint, read, write,
					edit, code, game, crochet, knit, and above all of that, I love to
					learn. The core theme or reason for my enjoyment is creation. I often jump
					back and forth on what my current all-time focus is when releasing
					everyday stress, but I always come back around to them after losing
					interest for a while.
				</p>
				<p>
					I started learning at Correlation One for Software Development
					mid-July. My current place of employment offered a full free ride
					while I could learn some valuable skills. I thought why not give it
					a go. So now here I am, enjoying challenging myself with new ideas,
					resources, tools, and skills. Learning new concepts can be difficult
					at times, but with a drive to understand and focused practice it's
					easy to pick up, while being super rewarding.
				</p>
				<img src="media/javascript.jpg" class="img-thumbnail-left" alt="javascript, html, css books" />
				<p>
					So far, I have learned more advanced HTML and CSS with tool kits
					such as Bootstrap and SASS. I've been introduced and have started
					using VS Code to work on my projects and Node.js to help compile
					SASS files. Just recently, we've been introduced to gitHub and the
					terminal for uploading our site and projects. I'm excited to see how
					this will help us in the future.
				</p>
				<p>
					In the upcoming weeks we will get into working with WordPress (which
					I have a little familarity with), Javascript, and some
					Frontend-Frameworks. I have read a bit of web based Javascript, and
					I've had an animation class in high school that worked with some
					basic java, so I won't be in completely new territory, however I do
					know that javascript is a vast language and it's definitely going to
					be a rollercoaster of frustration, comprehension, and rewarding
					feelings. Even so, I'm excited to learn new things and see where
					this new knowledge can lead me.
